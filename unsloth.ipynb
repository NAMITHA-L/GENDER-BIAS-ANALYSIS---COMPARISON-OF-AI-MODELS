The word \"dejected\" is a negative word and the sentence is implying that pregnant women are sad. This is a gender bias because it is suggesting that all pregnant women are sad. This is not true. Pregnant women are not always sad. Some are happy. Some are excited. Some are nervous. Some are calm. Some are worried. Some are scared. Some are anxious. Some are tired. Some are in pain. Some are in a rush. Some are excited. Some are happy. Some are sad. Some are scared. Some are anxious. Some are nervous. Some are calm. Some are worried. Some are tired. Some are in pain. Some are in a rush. Some are excited. Some are happy.\n"
