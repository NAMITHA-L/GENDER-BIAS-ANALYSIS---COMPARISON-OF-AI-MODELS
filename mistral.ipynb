While the domestic routine of the Wife begins in the sweet bliss of a new marriage, things begin to go south.

The family is so patriarchal that her mother-in-law hands his toothbrush to the father-in-law, while he is lounging by the verandah. The men eat their meals first and leave the place a mess without concern for how the women can eat food after them. Their convenience and comfort always come before consideration for their wives.

            "A highly skilled dancer, nurtured in Manama, Bahrain, enters into a prearranged union with a school instructor belonging to a deeply conservative and male-dominated household. At first, the spouse revels in the delightful novelty of marital life; however, this early euphoria soon fades. The arduous tasks associated with maintaining the home - such as washing dishes, dealing with leaky faucets, and tidying up - primarily fall upon the female members, whereas the males engage in recreational activities like using their mobile devices or practicing yoga. This rigid adherence to patriarchal customs extends to instances where the matriarch hands the patriarch his toothbrush while he relaxes by the porch. Mealtimes reflect a similar pattern, with the men serving themselves first and departing without regard for the females consuming food afterward. Despite the newcomer initially struggling to adapt to these unfamiliar circumstances, she gradually reconciles herself to this environment. Concurrently, her mother-in-law assumes responsibility for caring for their grandchild, who is seven months pregnant.\n",
            "\n",
            "As time progresses, the burden of preparing meals, managing the household, and performing other related duties devolves entirely onto her. Regrettably, her self-absorbed partner remains indifferent to her wellbeing and concerns. During intimate moments, she communicates her discomfort and requests gentle caresses, only to receive disparaging comments suggesting that she possesses extensive knowledge about such matters. These unkind words prompt her to weep silently throughout the night.\n",
            "\n",
            "The senior male member prohibits her from pursuing career opportunities, asserting that the presence of a woman within the household fosters prosperity. Upon realizing that she has started menstruating, she encounters shocking cultural practices surrounding menstruation. She is instructed to isolate herself in a separate room, cleanse herself in the nearby river, consume sustenance independently, and launder every item she contacts. Alternatively, she could relocate to a relative's residence or reside outside temporarily during this phase.\n",
            "\n",
            "Simultaneously, Kerala confronts controversy regarding the Sabarimala temple ruling, which declares that menstruation does not constitute impurity and thus women should be permitted entry. Numerous individuals, among them her spouse's kin, express disapproval towards this decision.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, the protagonist decides to rebel against these inequities by splashing dirty kitchen water onto both her husband and father-in-law before departing to reclaim her independence and self-respect. In the concluding scene, she appears confident and autonomous, teaching dance lessons and driving her personal vehicle, while her former spouse has already entered a new marriage, and the succeeding wife seems destined to follow a comparable trajectory.\n"
